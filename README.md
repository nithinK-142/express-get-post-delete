## Express.js API with GET, POST, and DELETE Methods

This repository provides a simple Express.js API that supports HTTP GET, POST, and DELETE methods. It's a basic setup for creating and managing resources using a RESTful approach.

### Requirements
- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment for building server-side applications.
- **Express:** Node.js web application framework for building APIs.
- **Axios:** A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to external resources.

### Getting Started

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nithinK-142/express-get-post-delete.git
```

#### 2. Navigate to the Repository

```bash
cd express-get-post-delete
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### 4. Run the Server

```bash
node server.js
```

#### 5. Run the Application
